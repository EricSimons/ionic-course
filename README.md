Mastering the Ionic Framework: Learn to Build & Deploy Native Speed HTML5 Based Apps
=======

This repository contains the markdown and code for the [Mastering Ionic course hosted on Thinkster.io](https://thinkster.io/ionic-framework-tutorial/). Pull requests are more than welcome for typos, code errors, etc :)

### Getting the base project set up
Run the command `npm install`. Then follow the rest of the course, starting at the section ["Starting our project"](https://thinkster.io/ionic-framework-tutorial/#starting-our-project).

If you want the source code of the final working Ionic application, make sure you have [Thinkster Pro](https://thinkster.io/pro) and then download it from the course page on Thinkster.

### Need help?
